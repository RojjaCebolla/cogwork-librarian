## colors and color identity

Filter cards by specific colors or number of colors with `color`.
Specify colors with WUBRG, color name (blue), or color combination nickname (boros, cabaretti, necra, etc.).
The `:` operator is equivalent to `>=` for this filter for non-colorless searches.
- aliases: `c`, `color`
- operators: `:`, `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, `<>`
- values: number, `c`, any of `wubrg`, color names, and color combinations
